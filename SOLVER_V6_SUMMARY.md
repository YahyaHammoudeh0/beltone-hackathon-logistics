# VibeCoders Solver v6 - Dijkstra Pathfinding

## Overview

VibeCoders_solver_6.py replaces BFS with **Dijkstra's algorithm** for pathfinding - the single most important algorithmic improvement in our solver evolution.

## Key Innovation: BFS → Dijkstra

### The Problem with BFS

**BFS (Breadth-First Search)** finds the shortest path by **number of hops** (edges):
- Path with 100 short edges (10 km total) is chosen over...
- Path with 2 long edges (8 km total)
- **Wrong optimization metric for VRP!**

### The Solution: Dijkstra

**Dijkstra's algorithm** finds the shortest path by **actual distance**:
- Uses edge weights (distances from env.get_distance())
- Finds TRUE shortest path by distance
- **Correct optimization metric for VRP!**

### Example

```
Warehouse → Order:

BFS chooses:
  [WH] --1km--> [A] --0.5km--> [B] --0.5km--> [Order]
  Total: 3 hops, 2 km ❌

Dijkstra chooses:
  [WH] --------1.5km--------> [Order]
  Total: 1 hop, 1.5 km ✅

Result: 25% shorter path!
```

## Performance Results

3. **Lower cost** ($6,985 vs $7,019)
4. **Shorter distances** (237 km vs 245 km)
5. **Same speed** (0.13s vs 0.11s)

## Algorithm Design

### Core Dijkstra Implementation

```python
def find_path_dijkstra(env, start_node, end_node, adjacency_list, max_distance=float('inf')):
    """
    Find TRUE shortest path by distance using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    """
    distances = {start_node: 0.0}
    previous = {}
    pq = [(0.0, start_node)]  # Priority queue: (distance, node)
    visited = set()

    while pq:
        current_dist, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_node == end_node:
            # Reconstruct path
            path = []
            node = end_node
            while node in previous:
                path.append(node)
                node = previous[node]
            path.append(start_node)
            return path[::-1]

        if current_node in visited or current_dist > max_distance:
            continue

        visited.add(current_node)

        # Explore neighbors with actual distances
        for neighbor in adjacency_list.get(current_node, []):
            edge_dist = env.get_distance(current_node, neighbor)
            new_dist = current_dist + edge_dist

            if neighbor not in distances or new_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = new_dist
                previous[neighbor] = current_node
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor))

    return None  # No path found
```

### Fallback Strategy

V6 includes **BFS fallback** if Dijkstra fails:
1. Try Dijkstra first (optimal)
2. If fails, fall back to BFS (robust)
3. If both fail, route creation fails

This provides **best of both worlds**: Dijkstra's optimality + BFS's robustness.

## Why This Works

### Hypothesis: BFS Was The Bottleneck

**Evidence**:
1. **V4 (BFS 2000) → 76% fulfillment** (worse than V3)
2. **V6 (Dijkstra) → 89% fulfillment** (same as V3)
3. **Increasing BFS limit didn't help** (V4: 1000→2000 nodes, still failed)
4. **Changing algorithm DID help** (Dijkstra: back to 89%)

**Conclusion**: The problem wasn't BFS's search depth, it was the **optimization metric** (hops vs distance).

### Impact on Scenario 4

**Scenario 4 Competition Results**:
- robin_testcase: 100% (likely uses Dijkstra/A*)
- V3 (BFS 500): 11%
- V4 (BFS 2000): 11% (no improvement!)
- **V6 (Dijkstra): TBD** (needs competition testing)

**Prediction**: V6 should achieve **60-80% on scenario 4** (major improvement)

## Computational Complexity

### Time Complexity

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| BFS | O(V + E) | V = vertices, E = edges |
| Dijkstra (binary heap) | O((V + E) log V) | With priority queue |
| Dijkstra (Fibonacci heap) | O(E + V log V) | Theoretical optimum |

**Impact**: Dijkstra is **slightly slower** than BFS, but:
- V6 runtime: 0.13s avg (vs V4: 0.11s avg)
- Difference: +0.02s (negligible)
- **Trade-off is worth it** for 13% fulfillment improvement

### Space Complexity

Both BFS and Dijkstra: **O(V)** for visited set and queue/priority queue

## Strengths

1. ✅ **True shortest paths**: Finds paths by distance, not hops
2. ✅ **Best average**: 89.2% (tied with V3, better than V4)
3. ✅ **Most consistent**: 9/10 at 90%+ (best of any version)
4. ✅ **Lower cost**: $6,985 avg (shortest distances = lower cost)
5. ✅ **Lower distance**: 237 km avg (proof Dijkstra finds shorter paths)
6. ✅ **Fast**: 0.13s avg (still well under 30-minute limit)
7. ✅ **Robust fallback**: BFS backup if Dijkstra fails

## Weaknesses

1. ⚠️ **Slightly slower**: 0.13s vs 0.11s (but still negligible)
2. ⚠️ **Still has variance**: 64%-94% range (1 outlier at 64%)
3. ⚠️ **Unknown competition performance**: Needs testing on scenarios 3 & 4

## Why V6 Over V3?

### V3 (ALNS, BFS 500)
- ✅ 89.2% average (same as V6)
- ❌ Complex ALNS might destabilize
- ❌ BFS 500 (wrong metric)
- ❌ 30-95s runtime
- ❌ 0% and 11% failures in competition

### V6 (Simple, Dijkstra)
- ✅ 89.2% average (same as V3)
- ✅ Simple greedy construction
- ✅ Dijkstra (correct metric)
- ✅ 0.13s runtime (much faster)
- ✅ 9/10 consistency
- ❓ Unknown competition performance

**Verdict**: V6 is the **safer choice** - same average, simpler, faster, better pathfinding

## Why V6 Over V4?

### V4 (BFS 2000)
- ❌ 76.2% average (worse)
- ❌ BFS 2000 (wrong metric, didn't help)
- ✅ Simple construction
- ✅ 0.11s runtime

### V6 (Dijkstra)
- ✅ 89.2% average (+13%)
- ✅ Dijkstra (correct metric)
- ✅ Simple construction
- ✅ 0.13s runtime (negligible difference)

**Verdict**: V6 is **strictly better** - higher fulfillment, correct algorithm, similar speed

## Submission Recommendation

### Primary Submission: V6 ⭐

**Reasons**:
1. **Correct pathfinding algorithm** (Dijkstra vs BFS)
2. **Strong average** (89.2%)
3. **High consistency** (9/10 at 90%+)
4. **Shortest paths** (lower cost & distance)
5. **Fast** (0.13s, well under limit)
6. **Simple & maintainable** (no complex ALNS)

### Backup Submission: V3

If V6 fails in competition:
- V3 also has 89.2% average
- Includes ALNS optimization
- Proven in early competition tests
- But has known failures (0%, 11%)

## Expected Competition Performance

### Scenario-by-Scenario Prediction

| Scenario | Previous (V4) | Predicted (V6) | Confidence |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | 100% | 100% | High |
| 2 | 90% | 90-95% | High |
| **3** | **0%** | **0-20%** | **Low** (both solvers fail) |
| **4** | **11%** | **60-80%** | **Medium** (Dijkstra should help!) |
| 5 | 100% | 100% | High |
| 6 | 97% | 95-100% | High |

**Key improvement**: Scenario 4 should jump from 11% to 60-80% with Dijkstra

## Future Improvements (If V6 Still Fails)

1. **Multi-warehouse pickup** (not implemented yet)
2. **A* instead of Dijkstra** (heuristic-guided search)
3. **2-opt local search** (optimize route order)
4. **Savings Algorithm** (better initial construction)
5. **Bidirectional Dijkstra** (faster pathfinding)

## Conclusion

V6 represents the **most important algorithmic improvement** in our solver evolution:

- ✅ **Correct algorithm**: Dijkstra finds true shortest paths
- ✅ **Strong performance**: 89.2% avg, 9/10 at 90%+
- ✅ **Lower cost**: $6,985 avg (shortest paths)
- ✅ **Simple & fast**: 0.13s runtime
- ✅ **Best chance**: To fix scenario 4 (11% → 60-80%?)

**Recommendation**: **Submit V6 as primary solution** for the Beltone AI Hackathon.
